I'm developing a simple 2D game engine based on core pygame functionality.

Current features:

    - ability to interact with sprites using the mouse
    - ability to drag sprites on screen 
    - ability to select topmost overlapping sprite
    
Features under development:

    - Game-state manager and default state builder
        - Client menu
        - Main (in-game) menu
        - Pause menu with locked inputs
        - Game loop 
 
    - Pop-up and mouse-over menus
    - Card manipulation related core objects:
        - Hand
        - Card stack
