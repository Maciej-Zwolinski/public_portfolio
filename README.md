This repository will be updated with my most recently finished or ongoing projects. Below you can find short descriptions of each folder.


1. Backprop - this is my implementation of Backpropagation algorithm for Dense Neural Network in C. It's main purpose was to test my C programing abilities.~~ Status:   WIP - testing and optimisation, memory cleanup ~~
  
  
2. Zadanie_wav - this is my tool for analising .wav files and finding sudden drops in signal (potential corruptions).
